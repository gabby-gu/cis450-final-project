# About the Project

Using databases from Letterboxd and MovieLens, we have created a movie recommendation website for users. CineScore includes a home page, displaying recent and highly rated movies, along with users who have rated a high number of movies. It also provides movie overview and user profile pages. Cinescore implements a fully functinoal search page where users can filter through movies using keywords and tags.
